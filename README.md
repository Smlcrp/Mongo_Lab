Using Mongo was surprisingly easy. I was under the impression that working inside the mongo db was going to be like learning another language with all different syntax, but I was pleasantly surpised to be wrong. After creating the employees collection, everything else was very straight forward. I was able to find and update all the date in the collection the way I wanted with no errors. The one problem I faced was with the updating the value of a specific data set, but I found I was using the .find() method instead of the .update() method. I was very relieved to find out that it was a little syntax error, and not me misunderstanding the information.
